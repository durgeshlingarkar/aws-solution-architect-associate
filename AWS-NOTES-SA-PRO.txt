Domain 8 - Cloud Migration & Hybrid

- VCenter has a pluggin that enables you to migrate VMware VMs to Amazon EC2 and manage AWS resources from within VCenter.
- Usecases for this are 
	- Migrate VMWare VMs to Amazon EC2
	- Reach new geographies from VCenter
	- Self service AWS portal within VCenter
	- Leverage VCenter experience while getting started with AWS.
	
- Use Storage gateway to migrate your existing VMs to AWS
- To ensure snapshots are consistent, power down your VM and then take the snapshot in offline mode.

- Data Pipeline
	- Data pipeline is a webservice that helps you to process or move data between different AWS compute and storage services.
	- Can be ingerated with on premises environment
	- Can be scheduled
	- Data pipeline will provision and terminate resources as and when required. 
	- A lot of data pipeline's functionality is replaced by LAMBDA
	- A data pipeline consists of 
		- Datanode : where you are gonna store the data.
		- Activity : Any activity to process/move data
		- Precondition : Conditions or filter to trigger activity
		- Schedule : Schedule for activity to run

VPC & CIDR 

- When you create a subnet, you create a CIDR block for the subnet. The allowed block size is between /28 netmask and /16 netmask. 
- If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets must not overlap.
- 5 IP addressed are always reserved per CIDR block. Following are the reseved IP addresses for CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24
	- 10.0.0.0 - Network address
	- 10.0.0.1 - Reserved by AWS for VPC router.
	- 10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon provided DNS.
	- 10.0.0.3 - Reserved by AWS for future use.
	- 10.0.0.255 - Network broadcast address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore they reserve this address.
	
	

VPN to Direct Connect Migrations. 

- Most customers will have site-to-site VPN tunnel from their location to AWS. But as traffic gets heavier, they will opt to use direct connect.
- Once direct connect is installed, you should configure it so that your VPN connection & your direct connect connection are within the same BGP community. You then configure BGP, so that your VPN connection has a higher cost than the Direct connect connection. 


Networking Components

Elastic Network Interfaces

- An elastic network interface (referred to as a network interface in this documentation) is a virtual network interface that can include the following attributes:

	- a primary private IPv4 address
	- one or more secondary private IPv4 addresses
	- one Elastic IP address per private IPv4 address
	- One public IPv4 address, which can be auto-assigned to the network interface for eth0 when you launch an instance
	- one or more IPv6 addresses
	- one or more security groups
	- a MAC address
	- a source/destination check flag
	- a description
	
- You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance.
- Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface (the primary network interface) that is assigned a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC. You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance.
- You can create and attach an additional network interface to any instance in your VPC. The number of network interfaces you can attach varies by instance type.


Domain 7 : Scalability & Elasticity

Cloudfront 

- is used to deliver entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. 
- Requests for contents are automaticallu routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with best possible performance. Cloudfront is optimized to work with with other webservices like S3, EC2, ELB & Route53. 
- 2 types of distributions 
	- Web Distribution - Streams HTTP protocol
	- RTMP - Streams RTMP protocol
- Geo restriction also called as Geo blocking lets you choose the countries where you want to restrict access to your content. 
- Whitelists or Blacklists particular countries using either API or console. 
- Viewers from blacklisted countries will see HTTP 403 error. You can also create custom error pages. 
- Cloudfront supports GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS.
- It does not cache responses to POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests, these requests are proxied back to origin server. 
- You can use both HTTP & HTTPS with cloudfront. 
- With SSL, you can use the default cloudfront URL or ur custom URL with your own certificate.
- For custom URL with your own certificates there are 2 ways 
	- Dedicated IP custom SSL : Allocated dedicated IP addresses to serve your SSL content to each cloudfront edge location. Very expensive. $600 USD per certificate per month. However, will support older browsers. 
	- SNI custom SSL : Relies on SNI (Server Name Indication) extenstion of transport layer security protocol, which allows multiple domains to serve SSL traffic over  the same IP address by including the hostname, viewers are trying to connect to. Older browsers won't support it. 
- CNAME : You can have 100 CNAMES aliases to each distribution. Cloudfront supports wildcard CNAMES. 
- Invalidations Requests : There are multuiple options for removing a file from the edge locations. You can simple delete the file from your origin and as content in the edge locations reaches the expiration period defined in the each object's HTTP header, it will be removed. If there is offensive or potentially harmful material that needs to be removed before the expiration then you can use Invalidation API to remove the object from all cloudfront edge locations. 
- Zone APEX Support : Using Route53, AWS's authoritative DNS service, you can configure an 'Alias' record that lets you map the apex or root (example.com) of your DNS name to your AMAZON Cloudfront distribution. Eg http://example.com --> http://d12878rt.cloudfront.net . Route53 will then respond to each request with the right IP addresses for your Cloudfront distribution. Route53 doesn't charge for queries to Alias records that are mapped to a cloudfront distribution. 
- Dynamic content support : Cloudfront supports delivery of dynamic content that is customized or personalized using HTTP cookies. To use this feature, you specify whether you want cloudfront to forward some or all cookies to ur custom origin server. cloudfront that considers the forwarded cookie values when identifying a unique object in it's cache. This way you end users get both the benefit of content that is personalized just for them with a cookie and the performance benefits of cloudfront. You can optionally choose to log the cookie values in cloudfront access logs. 
- Cost Saving with Amazon CloudFront
	-Amazon CloudFront has no minimum commitments and charges you only for what you use. 
	- Compared to self-hosting, Amazon CloudFront spares you from the expense and complexity of operating a network of cache servers in multiple sites across the internet and eliminates the need to over-provision capacity in order to serve potential spikes in traffic.
	-Amazon CloudFront also uses techniques such as collapsing simultaneous viewer requests at an edge location for the same file into a single request to your origin server. This reduces the load on your origin servers reducing the need to scale your origin infrastructure, which can bring you further cost savings.
	- if you are using an AWS origin (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, etc.), effective December 1, 2014, we are no longer charging for AWS data transfer out to Amazon CloudFront. This applies to data transfer from all AWS regions to all global CloudFront edge locations.
- CloudFront supports origin redundancy
	- For every origin that you add to a CloudFront distribution, you can assign a backup origin that can used to automatically serve your traffic if the primary origin is unavailable
	- You can choose a combination of HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes that, when returned from the primary origin, trigger the failover to the backup origin. The two origins can be any combination of AWS and non-AWS origins.
- CloudFront Regional Edge Cache
	- CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. The regional edge caches are located between your origin web server and the global edge locations that serve content directly to your viewers. This helps improve performance for your viewers while lowering the operational burden and cost of scaling your origin resources.
- Amazon CloudFront establishes WebSocket connections only when the client includes the 'Upgrade: websocket' header and the server responds with the HTTP status code 101 confirming that it can switch to the WebSocket protocol.
- Field-Level Encryption is a feature of CloudFront that allows you to securely upload user-submitted data such as credit card numbers to your origin servers. Using this functionality, you can further encrypt sensitive data in an HTTPS form using field-specific encryption keys (which you supply) before a PUT/ POST request is forwarded to your origin. 
- Usecase for field level encryption 
	- Many web applications collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers from users that is then processed by application services running on the origin infrastructure. All these web applications use SSL/TLS encryption between the end user and CloudFront, and between CloudFront and your origin. Now, your origin could have multiple micro-services that perform critical operations based on user input. However, typically sensitive information only needs to be used by a small subset of these micro-services, which means most components have direct access to these data for no reason. A simple programming mistake, such as logging the wrong variable could lead to a customer’s credit card number being written to a file.With field-level encryption, CloudFront’s edge locations can encrypt the credit card data. From that point on, only applications that have the private keys can decrypt the sensitive fields. So the order fulfillment service can only view encrypted credit card numbers, but the payment services can decrypt credit card data. This ensures a higher level of security since even if one of the application services leaks cipher text, the data remains cryptographically protected.
- Amazon CloudFront has an optional private content feature. When this option is enabled, Amazon CloudFront will only deliver files when you say it is okay to do so by securely signing your requests.
